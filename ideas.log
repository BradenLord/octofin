Game ideas:

Here are the stats/counters/tags

Tags determine what counters and other stats apply to an attack.  Every attack can have one combat syle and multiple damage types. 
For attacks with multiple types the stats the modifers are averaged from all involved.
Tags:
Combat styles - Melee, Ranged, Magic
Normal Damage Type - Pierce, Slash, Blunt
Elemental Damage Type - Fire, Ice, Electric, Nature, Light, Dark

Combat Stats~
Accuracy - Ignores Defence
Focus - Ignores Resistance
Defence - Reduces Normal Damage
Resistance - Reduces Elemental Damage
Vitality - Maximum Hitpoints

Strength Modifiers~
Might - % Damage bonus to Melee
Precision - % Damage bonus to Ranged
Power - % Damage bonus to Magic

Avoidance Modifiers~
Blocking - % Chance to avoid Melee Damage
Deflection - % Chance to avoid Ranged Damage
Absorbtion - % Chance to avoid Magic damgae

Utility Modifiers~
Regeneration - % Bonus to hitpoint  recovery
Speed - % Bonus to movement speed
Stamina - % Bonus to stamina recovery
Savagery - % chance to crit
Lethality - % bonus damage crits do


Counters:

Bonuses stack with greater than linear increase (in both directions)
Damage and Combat Syle counters do NOT stack with each other (in terms of linear increase) Negative counters do the same, but remove stats.

Max counters: -20 to 20

First %: 1%
First Minimum Bonus: 5
First Secondary %: 0%

Max %: 50%
Max Minimum Bonus: 250
Max Secondary %: 25%

Secondary bonus starts at 10 counters

Damage Counters~
Applies to damage type if tagged on attack.
Attack counter - %Increase to Accuracy or Focus (whichever applies), minimum flat bonus.  Increases strength with many stacks.
Defence counter - %Increase to Defence or Resistance (whichever applies),  minimum flat bonus.  Increases avoidance with many stacks.

Combat Style Counters~
Applies to combat style if tagged on attack.
Attack counter - %Increase to Accuracy and Focus, minimum flat bonus.  Increases strength (whichever applies) with many stacks.
Defence counter - %Increase to Defence and Resistance, minimum flat bonus.  Increases avoidance (whichever applies) with many stacks.

Example:
Steel Curiass:

+50 defence
-15 resistance
+200 Hitpoints
-5 Magic Attack Counters
-2 Range Attack Counters
-3 Magic Defence Counters
+3 Pierce Defence Counters
+1 Slash Defence Counters


Skill Trees:

Can spec out general tree and one specific tree from each type.
Enough skill points to spec out 3 trees total.

Tactics - Some all purpose moves.  Some specialization for ranged attacks (thrown/bows).
Berserker - All out attacking!  Specializing in two handed weapons and swinging attacks.  May learn Fire/Electric special attacks.
Knight - Defensive bulwark.  Specializes in one handed axes and bludgeons (and shield attacks!).  May learn Light/Nature special attacks.
Bladedancer - Critical attacks and combos.  Specializes in blades, polearms and thrusting attacks.  May learn Dark/Ice special attacks.

Magical Arts - All purpose tree with general skills and buffs, (Chromatic magic that uses all elements at once?)
Chaos - Uses Fire/Dark attacks.  
Balance - Uses Nature/Ice attacks.
Justice - Light/Electric attacks.

Quality and Rarity
Qualities: Excellent, Strong, Good, Average, Poor, Weak, Damaged
% effect of positive base stats/modifiers: 50, 25, 10, 0, -10, -25, -50
Does not effect special/effect bonuses or counters

Rarities: Very Common, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Elite, Legendary
Colors: Grey, White, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange

Items would have three tags:
Equipment type (Consumable, Weapon, Upper Body, ect), Subtype (depends on main type) and the Material Type (Metals, Lethers, or 'unique')

Battle text colors
Damage: White
Critical: Red
Heal: Green
Avoidance: Blue
Mez/Cc/negative status: Orange (eq Stunned!)
Buffs/Other: Yellow

Damage Type Colors:
Pierce: Red
Slash: Yellow
Crush: Brown
Fire: Orange
Ice: Cyan
Nature: Green
Electricity: Purple
LIght: White
Dark: Black 

Elemental icons (with colors mentioned above):
Pierce: Sword Stabbing up
Slash: Diagonal Sword
Crush: Clenched armored fist punching down
Fire: Flame
Ice: Snowflake
Nature: Tree
Electricity: Lightning Bolt
Light: Angel Wing Profile
Dark: Skull

Use Icon Framework for skill icons (because there are googd ones).
Weapon/Stat Icons in a similar style (but made custom)

Random weapon unique boni
Higher chance with higher quality of weapon.
3 Tiers, up to 3 Slots available
Same with secondaries!

Two handed weapons should have access to more bonus slots to compensate.

Armor has Set bonuses?
Accessories have set bonuses?

Certain generic tiered set boni that certain armor/accessories have a chance to belong to.

Item levels:
Items have levels (1-1000 (and more maybe))

Items have base stats that do not change and dynamic stats.
Base stats used for negatives or unique boni accross item levels
Dynamic stats scale the same for every item, but each item has a set of ratios for each stat (0.0 - 2.0) that is a multiplier
Quality and Rarity have additional multipliers on top of this.

Items have a minimum and maximum item level. 
Higher levels of crafting yeild higher item levels of items.

Enemy levels
Enemies have levels too (1- 1000 (and more maybe))

Enemies' items' levels will be close to their level
same with their drops

Enemies have base stats and dynamic stats like items, except each enemy has a defined stat gain per level.

Enemies also have a 'quality' (only positive).  Increases dynamic stats and relative item levels (equipped and loot)
Base names for these, but each enemy can override.  These labels are prefixed to the name.
(Normal, Veteran, Elite)

Player has average item and skill level.
Skill level based on number of skill points used, average item level for average of all items equipped.

Equpiment can have random stat bonues from rank 1-10 (eg Iron Curiass of +3 Defence)
More likely and more likely to be higher rank with rarity.  Scales with item level and quality (not rarity)
on the same equipment scale.

Example full item name:
Damaged Vampyric Flaming Royal Longsword of +10 Strength


Non-combat skills:
Adventuring
Uncovering hidden passages in environments, better rates/etc at resource nodes.  Food prep
Use unique "Tool" class of items

Crafting:
Making all sorts of items.  Converting raw materials (gathered from Adventuring) into material
in order to craft with.

Other stuff:
Should be able to exanmine corpses of fallen foes to see items/stats

Ability (for large monsters) that allow them to use two handed weapons one handed

Town centers (require you to do quests for them to enter)
where you can buy/sell goods/equipment for materials and trade materials

Weapon types:
Blade, Axe, Bludgeon, Polearm, Magical (staffs, wands etc), Thrown, Bow
Styles:
One Handed, Two Handed

World Map:

Predefined shape with guaranteed features (location of The Cataclysm and Ocean is known).  Regions themselves randomized.
Player would randomly start on a region type of their choice (effects starting equipment)
Strategic balance of region/environment types to ensure that game has all content required. All environments will have a minumum preplaced globally, afterwhich percentages come into play.
Quest maps spawn in any region (distance from player determined by the quest, quest message/log will roughly imply how close it is/was to the region in which it was discovered).
All quests in known territory will show up on map (can be clicked to locate in quest log!)

Settlement quests, for example, will likely have a range of 0, maybe 1 and will be treated as Side quests.
Side quests are random.  Settlements would provide most, but can maybe find them in the wild (not sure how yet).

In the base game Oceans would be non-navigatable (water tiles, lakes, could appear on the map)

Basic Region Types based on a matching of Temperature and Wetness

Temperatures - Arid/Temperate/Arctic
Wetness - Wet/Average/Dry

9 base possibilites:

Arid/Wet - Jungle
Arid/Average - Desert
Arid/Dry - Desert

Temperate/Wet - Swamp
Temperate/Average - Forest
Temperate/Dry - Plains

Arctic/Wet - Forest
Arctic/Average - Tundra 
Arctic/Dry - Arctic (heavy snow/glaciers)

Mountains and Lakes possible anywhere (override territory)

Lakes are "Cold Water" in Arctic, "Warm Water" otherwise
Mountains change slightly based on temperature (mostly aesthetically)
Mountains most likely in Arid?

Arid most likely to be Dry
Temperate most likely to be Average
Arctic most likely to be Dry
(Wet is rarer in general)

Graphics:
Parchment effect for base:
Region discovered, name is displayed (map-like, cuz clicking on region will pop up with extra info)
Region gets slight tint, small terrain-based features are added in (as well as more detail in zoomout mode)

When environment/settlement is discovered it shows up on the region physically

Map made up of hexes.  Each region made up of multiple hexes
Each hex can be barren or have a feature (settlemen/environment)

1 guaranteed space for a potential settlement
1 guaranteed space for quest things
1 guaranteed environment per region

Therefore 3 is the minimum size
Travel costs based on terrain type; cost per hex

Ocean, Cataclysm and the surrounding Rift are special
Can't enter the of the Cataclysm region unless you explore rest of the Cataclysm

Regions are homogeneous unless they are special regions (ocean, cata, etc)

Have to unlock access to certian terrain (aka have item in possesion to enter)
Lakes require swimming enhancement
Rift requires the endgame item

Biome/Wetness map is relatively normal, except for regions touching the rift (rift is in the center of map, so cold area surrounds it)

Unique territory always starts on the map

Alive settlements have 3 stats
Trust
Development
Wealth

0-10 Scale (Probably bigger numbers for more nuance)

Trust starts from 0-4, 5 Trust required to enter town (levels debatable)
Trust gained by doing missions for the Town Guards
Trust 8 required to get settlement-enhancing missions from settlement (deets below)
Would go down over time.

Development - Determines how many people are in the settlement.  Likely
4 settlement types:
0 - Ruins -  If settlement reaches 0 it is destroyed! (would usually only happen with events)
1 - Village
4 - Town
8 - City

This would influence what buildings in the settlement the player can use
eg. Market might only show up at 2 development.  This can be improved
by doing missions for the Mayor (with 8 trust)
Fluctuates naturally over time.

Wealth - Determines how favorable it is to barter in a settlement and the
quality of goods available.
0 - Would mean bartering would almost be non-existient and when it is at extreme rates
1-10 - Higher numbers mean better (and more exotic!) goods and cheaper prices for the player
Quests to improve it would be available from Guildmaster (with 8 trust)

Certain global events would trigger that could drastically change this stats (player would probably be notified)
Eg: 
Earthquake reduces Development and Wealth by a decent chunk
Bandit Raid reduces trust slightly and Wealth by a good amount.
Bumper Crop increases Development a decent amount and wealth slightly.

Skill and Stats and Damage rethink

Damage Types:

Pierce
Slash
Blunt
Bleed
Poison
Fire
Ice
Electric
Nature 
Light 
Dark

Slight changes to stat

Combat Stats~
Accuracy - Ignores Defence
Focus - Ignores Resistance
Defence - Reduces Physical Damage
Resistance - Reduces Magical Damage
Vitality - Maximum Hitpoints

Damage Modifiers~
Might - % Damage bonus to Physical
Power - % Damage bonus to Magical
Savagery - % chance to crit with Physical damage
Lethality - % bonus damage Physical crits do
Mastery - % chance to crit with Magical damage
Execution - % bonus damage Magical crits do

Avoidance Modifiers~
Deflection - % Chance to avoid Physical Damage
Absorption - % Chance to avoid Magical Damage

(Side note: Avoidance would roll for each damage type separately)

Utility Modifiers~
Regeneration - % Bonus to hitpoint recovery
Speed - % Bonus to movement speed
Stamina - % Bonus to Skill recharge rate

Damage Type Modifiers (no counters, screw counters)
Each damage type has modifiers for Combat/Damage/Avoidance stats

Example:

Stat Modifiers (Apply to both Physical and Magical):

          (sword)	     (shield)
Slash    + 10 ( 1% )	+ 5 ( 0.5% )

In this case this would mean that you gain a +10 Affinity and +1% Damage for Slash damage
and +5 Protection and +0.5% Avoidance when defending against Slash damage.

          (sword)	     (shield)
Fire      + 10 ( 1% )	 + 5 ( 0.5% )

In this case this would mean that you gain a +10 Affinity and +1% Damage for Fire damage
and +5 Resistance and +0.5% Avoidance when defending against Fire damage.

No Skill Trees or talents

Skills have to be 'found' or 'discovered' apart from a basic set of skills.
Skills and Equipment require certain ability scores.

Ability points start at 0 and cap at 100.

Armour commonly gives vitality (no vitality gained by ability score)

Lore:

Medieval Era tech, but NOT european tech

Players pick a race (sky/water people would be 'half-breeds' or 'forsaken'.  Something that doesn't start with wings/gills), melee class and mage class to start.

Main story line:

Main Quest:
    Rebirth of Civilization

You are a strong adventurer of your people.  Word from travelling merchants has just reached your town of a human community known, as Sanctuary.  This city is to be the capital of
the world's first modern kingdom ushering in a return to civilization.
	
You search the map for Sanctuary (spawns quite far away from starting location) and when you find it you see it is in ruins.  Bodies are strewn as if a massive battle had taken place.
	
Main Quest:
	Seeker of Truth
	
In Sanctuary you find a nearly collapsed building with several wounded, but alive people inside.  The elder tells you that an unknown army weilding powerful magic killed and destroyed everything here.  He tells
you of a wise old Sage that may know who these soldiers were and how to stop them.  After you finish talking a Prisma Soldier (likely the first one you've seen unless you grinded for a long time) enters and you must defeat him. 

Main Quest:
	The Silver Serpent
	
You find the sage in a run-down stone tower filled with books (read some for lore?).  The Sage welcomes you, but does not immediately trust you.  You must prove yourself worthy of his secrets.  
He wants you to bring him the head of [Romulus?], the leader of the Silver Legion.  You must find Romulus' fortress, gain access and defeat him.

The Silver Legion are an all inclusive band of rouges/mercenaries that take in those not accepted in/not fit for common life.  Their weapons, training and motivations may be better than common bandits, but their actions
are not as they plunder, pillage, and rob to get what they need.  Romulus is an middle-adged fellow that offers you some sympathy (he knows about the destruction of Sanctuary), but he can't let you live as he sees you as a threat.

You take his head as a trophy. Once you return the Sage is most pleased saying "No one man has been worthy of my knowledge in nearly 1000 years".  He tells you about the Prisma Soldiers and how their magic is linked
to direct exposure to the rift in the cataclysm.  To defeat the Prisma Soldiers you must close the gate to the Otherworld in the cataclysm.

Main Quest:
	Unlocking the Way
	
The Sage tells you of a magical Prisma Key that can seal the gate.  This key requires the sacred stones of each element to work.  Each culture has one such stone and you must seek them out by
any means. 

These stones are guarded by elite warriors of each culture in a sacred location.  You can get the stones by building trust with that culture (helping settlements/travelers) or by killing the guards
(omega hard).  There might be some different sub-quests based on each culture to gain their trust (along with the base culture trust mechanic).

Main Quest:
	Sealing Destiny
	
You give the sage the stones and key combines them with the holder/base that he has.  He tells you you must find the epicenter of the cataclysm and use this key on the rift that was opened there.
The Prisma key is one of the few ways to pass the barrier in the Rift surrounding the epicenter.
A Prisma boss breaks into the tower and kills the Sage (sage is super weak).  You have to fight him afterwards.  Prisma Soldiers will now appear more often (very rare before) as they can sense the power 
eminating from the Prisma Key. They will likely allude to that fact (calling the player "Keybearer").  This will be a threat forever basically, even after the Old Man and General are defeated there are 
still plenty of Insane Prisma soldiers roaming the world.

The epicenter is home to a otherworldly castle.  At its top is a very old man who is guarding the portal.  He is the leader of the Prisma soldiers and has been absorbing the power of the rift for many
centuries, making him mad (crazy).  He thinks he is helping the world by using the magic to stop the evil created by the portal.  Closing the portal would be more effective, but he's addicted to the portal's magic.
You learn that all Prisma Soldiers are affected in the same way except for a General (and the General's immediate suboordinates) that refuse to use the Prisma magic. After you defeat the old man he comes to his senses
and realises what he's done.  He also tells you that he and the Sage were not human (why they lived for thousands of years) and actually originated from the lands on the other side of the portal (why the sage knows how
to close the cataclysm).  Being in this world renders their kind weak and frail (hence the old looking appearance) unless they absorb a large amount of magical essence from their world which unfortunately makes them insane.
He asks you to defeat the General and her forces and to close the gate; giving you a key to the General's Castle.  After he dies  you use the key on the Otherworld altar there turning the key into the Otherworld
key and closing the portal.  If you try to open the Otherworld portal you'll get self dialogue saying "I don't want to do that; yet" implying possible future content.

Main Quest:
	The Iron Fist
	
You find the General's castle.  She and her men don't use Prisma magic because it would make them mad, but they suggest ideas to the Prisma Soldiers because while unstable they are a very powerful tool.  The General's
ultimate goal is to become the martial ruler of the known world.  She wants to accomplish this by destroying any attempts of human sovereignty (why she destroyed Sanctuary at the cost of most of her men) as she grows her
power and numbers.  After you defeat her she tells you the reason for her goals.  This world needs a strong military leader to face the evil that has been growing in the Otherworld.  An evil that the Old Man
sensed and warned her about.  Leaders of towns/cities mocked and exiled her for working with the "tainted magic" of the Rift so she took the matter into her hands as the rulers of this world would not be properly prepared.
A matter that then passes on to you.

Fortunately the altar is sealed for now and the world is safe (end of the base story).  You will still see ocassional insane prisma soldiers in the world (less the before, but not less than base).  

Leads into good additional content for the Otherworld!
