Game ideas:

Here are the stats/counters/tags

Tags determine what counters and other stats apply to an attack.  Every attack can have one combat syle and multiple damage types. 
For attacks with multiple types the stats the modifers are averaged from all involved.
Tags:
Combat styles - Melee, Ranged, Magic
Normal Damage Type - Pierce, Slash, Blunt
Elemental Damage Type - Fire, Ice, Electric, Nature, Light, Dark

Dynamic stats scale the same for every item, but each item has a set of ratios for each stat (0.0 - 2.0) that is a multiplier
Quality and Rarity have additional multipliers on top of this.

Items have a minimum and maximum item level. 
Higher levels of crafting yeild higher item levels of items.

Enemy levels
Enemies have levels too (1- 1000 (and more maybe))

Enemies' items' levels will be close to their level
same with their drops

Enemies have base stats and dynamic stats like items, except each enemy has a defined stat gain per level.

Enemies also have a 'quality' (only positive).  Increases dynamic stats and relative item levels (equipped and loot)
Base names for these, but each enemy can override.  These labels are prefixed to the name.
